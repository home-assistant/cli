## Installation

The CLI is provided by the CLI container on Home Assistant systems and is
available on the device terminal when using the Home Assistant Operating System.

The CLI is automatically updated on those systems.

Furthermore, the SSH add-on (available in the add-on store) provides this
access to this tool and several community add-ons provide it as well (e.g.,
the Visual Studio Code add-on).

## Developing & contributing

### Prerequisites

The CLI can interact remotely with the Home Assistant Supervisor using the
`remote_api` add-on from the [developer add-ons repository](https://github.com/home-assistant/hassio-addons-development).

After installing and starting the add-on, a token is shown in the `remote_api`
add-on log, which is needed for further development.

### Get the source code

Fork ([https://github.com/home-assistant/cli/fork](https://github.com/home-assistant/cli/fork)) or clone this repository.

### Using it in development

```shell
export SUPERVISOR_ENDPOINT=http://192.168.1.2
export SUPERVISOR_API_TOKEN=replace_this_with_remote_api_token
go run main.go info
```

**Note**: Replace the `192.168.1.2` with the IP address of your Home Assistant
instance running the `remote_api` add-on and use the token provided.

### Building

We use go modules; an example build below:

```bash
CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -ldflags="-s -w" -o "ha"
```

For details how we build cross for different architectures,
please see our [build action file](https://github.com/home-assistant/cli/blob/master/.github/workflows/build.yml).
